# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Renamed the repo to `Linkuistics/skills` and the plugin to `linkuistics`
  (namespace `linkuistics:`); added an Apache-2.0 licence.
- Added the `grove` skill — a methodology for hierarchical, self-extending,
  git-tracked task-tree workstreams. Bundles three convention files from
  `mattpocock/skills` (MIT); upstream licence in `grove/LICENSES/`.
- Added `scripts/materialise-grove.sh` — copies grove into a consuming repo
  and stamps `VERSION.md`.
- Added `docs/grove.md` — problem, solution, install/update guidance, and example
  prompts. Restructured `README.md` to lead with grove as a top-level section
  alongside the coding-style skills.
- Made grove's heritage explicit up front in `docs/grove.md` and the README's
  `## grove` section: bundling of Matt Pocock's `grill-with-docs` conventions
  and DDD's Ubiquitous Language and bounded-context concepts.
- Made grove's single-worktree-per-grove convention explicit in `SKILL.md`
  (loop preamble) and `docs/grove.md` (the "Git worktrees" subsection now
  reads as directive rather than descriptive).
- Initial release. Coding standards packaged as agent skills:
  - `coding-style` — universal principles (auto-loads on any file).
  - `coding-style-{rust,python,elixir,bash,swift,typescript}` — per-language
    style guides, auto-loading by file extension.
  - `cli-tool-design` — LLM-friendly CLI design guidance, with the audit
    checklist and refactoring sequence split into `references/`.
- Claude Code marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).
- `install.sh` for symlinking skills into Codex / Gemini CLI.
