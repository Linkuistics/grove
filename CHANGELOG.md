# Changelog

## v2.1.0

- `grove install` and `grove update` now produce a single path-scoped git commit covering every targeted harness path (per ADR-0001). `--no-commit` opts out and prints the staging command; `-m`/`--message` overrides the default message. Pre-flight refuses if install-scope paths already have staged hunks; unrelated dirty state elsewhere is left alone. Hook failures leave the materialisation in place and print a follow-up `git commit -- <paths>`. Multi-harness invocations produce one combined commit; no-op materialisations skip the commit.
- New per-flow walkthroughs under `docs/workflows/` (install, update, start, multi-step, finish) with an index; README and `docs/grove.md` cross-link to them.
- Documentation clarifies that `grove continue` is a session launcher and notes that up-arrow history recall surfaces the last continue prompt.

## v2.0.0

Breaking on-disk layout change. Every storage location is now dot-prefixed and the per-grove namespace is gone where it was redundant.

- Task tree: `groves/<name>/` → `.grove/` (inside the grove's worktree). One worktree = one grove, so the name no longer needs to namespace the task tree.
- Worktree: `worktrees/<name>-grove/` on branch `<name>-grove` → `.grove-worktrees/<name>/` on branch `<name>`.
- Harness stamp: `groves/<name>/.harness` → `.grove-stamps/<name>`.
- `grove finish` now explicitly deletes `.grove/` in a focused commit before merging, so the default branch never carries any grove's local state. The history of completed groves lives in git's commit graph, not in retained `done/` directories.
- `grove uninstall`'s "live groves" check is now "any worktree exists in `.grove-worktrees/`" — simpler and authoritative.

Migration: existing groves on v1.x layout need manual relocation (`mv groves/<name> .grove-worktrees/<name>-grove/.grove`, then rebranch, then refresh content with `grove update`). New repos pick up the new layout automatically.

## v1.0.1

- Relicense from MIT to Apache-2.0 (matches sibling Linkuistics projects); add the missing LICENSE file at repo root.
- Add `docs/grove.md` — project-level intro covering the methodology rationale and the CLI's workstream verbs.

## v1.0.0

- Initial public release of the grove CLI.
- Lifecycle verbs: `install`, `update`, `uninstall`, `version`, `status`, `list`.
- Launcher verbs: `start`, `continue`, `takeover`, `retire`, `finish`.
- Multi-harness support with auto-detection of `.claude/` and `.codex/`; `.harness` stamp used as a per-grove disambiguator.
- Release pipeline producing macOS arm64 and Linux x86_64/arm64 binaries.
