# WHY THE WORKER CARRIES A SOURCE DIGEST. The worker builds only through this
# script, never from cargo, so nothing orders a `cargo test` after a worker
# rebuild. Instead the front's build.rs computes the same digest over the same
# files and refuses a worker that reports another one (exit 5, naming
# `task dispatch:worker`). The two implementations must agree byte for byte:
# the sorted `shasum -a 256` listing of `source_files`, hashed again. A
# disagreement fails every command-seam test loudly, so it cannot drift unseen.

# WHY A TARGET BUILD FETCHES ITS OWN RUNTIME. A cross-compiled worker is a copy
# of the target's `bun` with the policy host appended, so that runtime is part
# of what ships. Bun fetches it from npm into its install cache with no
# integrity check, and reuses any cached file of the right name unverified
# (bun-v1.4.2 src/options_types/compile_target.rs, `to_npm_registry_url` and
# `exe_path`; src/standalone_graph/StandaloneModuleGraph.rs,
# `target_executable`). So a target build downloads the same tarball itself,
# checks it against the digest pinned below, and hands the `bun` inside to
# `--compile-executable-path`, which skips Bun's fetch entirely. Each digest's
# tarball also matched npm's published `dist.integrity` when it was pinned.
# A Bun upgrade re-pins all three, replaces notices/bun-LICENSE.md from the new
# tag, and reruns the runtime-evidence probes.

# The shipped worker's autoload switches. All four are stated, even where
# 1.4.2's default already agrees, so that a Bun upgrade changing a default
# cannot change the build.
#
# WHY THE DOTENV SWITCH IS SOMETIMES THE ONLY CONTROL. For the files Bun reads
# as a process starts, the switch is one of two controls: the front also
# starts the worker in an empty directory of its own. Bun loads dotenv files
# again for each VM it starts, though, from the directory the process is then
# in (`start_vm`, and `clone_for_worker`, which marks no file loaded):
# https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/bun-v1.4.2/src/jsc/web_worker.rs
# https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/bun-v1.4.2/src/dotenv/env_loader.rs
# The worker has moved to `/` by the time a policy can start a native Worker
# (main.ts), so with this switch on such a Worker would load `/.env`. Seen on
# 2026-10-01 in a build with the switch on; see "A VM started later" under
# "The worker's directory" in the runtime evidence named below.
#
# WHY PACKAGE.JSON AUTOLOADING IS ON, AND WHAT MAKES THAT SAFE. Without it the
# resolver finds a package only by its file layout, so one whose entry `main`
# or `exports` declares, which is most published packages, does not load. The
# switch decides one resolver option, `load_package_json`
# (`apply_standalone_runtime_flags`), whose one reader records the
# package.json of each directory the resolver builds a record for
# (`dir_info_uncached`):
# https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/bun-v1.4.2/src/bun.js.rs
# https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/bun-v1.4.2/src/resolver/resolver.rs
# It builds one for more than the directories an import names. A module
# compiled into the worker, and any module with no file location, is resolved
# as though it sat in the directory the process is in
# (`resolve_and_auto_install`), and even an import of an absolute path builds
# that directory's record and each ancestor's (`resolve_without_symlinks`).
# The front starts the worker in a private directory under the caller's
# TMPDIR, so a worker that stayed there would read every package.json at or
# above TMPDIR whole on each evaluation. Seen on 2026-10-01: one past 4 GiB
# there stalled a plain policy to its deadline, and one with an `imports` map
# answered a `#` import from a `data:` module. So the switch is on only
# because the worker moves to `/` before it loads anything (main.ts). The
# `unmoved` probe, which does not move, still does both, and tests/hostile.rs
# holds the shipped worker to neither. `/package.json` is what remains, as
# `/node_modules` remained with the switch off.
#
# The switch also changes what an entry's own package.json does: its `imports`
# map applies, its own `name` resolves ahead of `node_modules`, and an
# `imports` alias to a registered specifier is a `node_modules` lookup that
# never reaches the embedded module (`load_package_imports`). The spec states
# each under *Policy authority and runtime discovery*. See "Package entry
# resolution", "The worker's directory" and "Package.json autoloading" in
# docs/design/harness-selection-and-execution/runtime-evidence.md.
