//! Resolve the selected command's program to the file `run` will exec
//! (`docs/specs/harness-selection-and-execution.md`, *Policy and the selected
//! command*).
//!
//! A program is an absolute path, a relative path containing a separator, which
//! resolves against the caller's cwd, or a name looked up in the caller's PATH.
//! The lookup is `execvp`'s, so dispatch launches what the caller's shell
//! would: an empty or relative PATH entry is relative to the cwd, and the first
//! executable regular file wins. Resolution happens once, and `run` execs the
//! resolved path, so what inspection reports is what runs.
//!
//! A missing program exits 127 and an unexecutable one 126, and nothing is
//! ever run in its place. A resolved path that is not UTF-8 is unexecutable
//! too: inspection reports the path as a string for its caller to execute,
//! and the lossy string of such a path names another file.
