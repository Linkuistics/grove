//! The signal state this process inherited, recorded before the Rust runtime
//! changes it, and handed to the harness
//! (`docs/specs/harness-selection-and-execution.md`, *Execution and authority*).
//!
//! The harness is to receive the signal mask, and every disposition that
//! survives exec, exactly as this process inherited them. Two facts of Rust's
//! standard library stand in the way, and both hold in 1.85.0, the workspace's
//! minimum, and in 1.98.1:
//!
//! - Before `main`, `lang_start` runs `sys::init`, whose `reset_sigpipe` sets
//!   SIGPIPE to ignored unless the unstable `-Zon-broken-pipe` is used
//!   (`library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/mod.rs`). Nothing in `main` can see the
//!   caller's SIGPIPE.
//! - A spawn with a `pre_exec` closure forks and runs `do_exec` in the child.
//!   It keeps the calling thread's mask, sets SIGPIPE to default, and only
//!   then runs the `pre_exec` closures before `execvp` (1.85.0:
//!   `library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/process/process_unix.rs`; 1.98.1:
//!   `library/std/src/sys/process/unix/unix.rs`). Nothing before those
//!   closures can restore SIGPIPE.
//!
//! So [`record`] runs from the executable's initializer section, which the
//! loader runs before the C `main` that calls `lang_start`, and [`entry`] hands
//! what it found to the runner as a transparent launch's entry state, which the
//! runner sets in its `pre_exec` closure. Exec keeps an ignored disposition and
//! resets every other one to default, so the ignored set and the mask are the
//! whole of what survives it. Every signal is handed on, not only SIGPIPE and
//! the three that cancel, so the harness receives its caller's state whatever
//! else in this process changed a disposition.
