//! Find, start, verify and converse with the compiled policy worker
//! (`docs/specs/harness-selection-and-execution.md`, *Policy authority and
//! runtime discovery*; `docs/adr/policy-evaluation-precedes-process-replacement.md`).
//!
//! The worker is found only relative to the real front executable. It starts in
//! a private empty directory with null stdin, a fresh environment
//! (`environment`), captured
//! stdout and stderr, and one socket at descriptor 3 as its private channel. It
//! leaves that directory for `/` before it loads anything, so that no ancestor
//! of the directory takes part in resolving a policy's imports. Its
//! first frame states its protocol and build identity, and the front checks both
//! before the worker learns which entry to evaluate: a worker from another build
//! is never handed a policy.
//!
//! The conversation has up to three phases. The worker loads the entry and
//! reports a snapshot of its policy, which the caller's judge validates while
//! the worker waits. Only then may the judge ask the worker, once, to assemble
//! the context, running the policy's `loadContext` if it has one, and it
//! validates and measures what comes back (*Bounded context*). While the loader
//! runs, each `host.run` is a request the front answers through the judge's
//! lookup, from the record store the worker never opens; the front keeps its
//! own answers, and the context must carry exactly those. Then the judge may
//! ask the worker, once, to call the policy's `select`, and it judges what that
//! produced against the snapshot it already holds. A judge that needs nothing
//! more simply ends the conversation, and the worker exits (*Policy and joint
//! choice*).
//!
//! Every frame the worker sends has a bound, which the worker checks before it
//! sends and the front checks again as it reads: the fixed protocol message
//! bound for a snapshot or a result, and the caller's context budget for a
//! context. The policy's output on both diagnostic streams is kept within one
//! shared bound. Past it the front stops reading into memory, stops the
//! worker, and refuses, rather than keeping a truncated account.
//!
//! The whole selection is bounded from the worker's start to its result, by the
//! front's own clock (*Bounded context*, *Execution and authority*). A policy
//! spinning at import or in `select`, or awaiting work that never settles,
//! cannot end itself, so the deadline relies on nothing the worker does: every
//! channel read and write, in either phase, waits only for the time left, and
//! at expiry the front stops and reaps the worker and refuses with exit 124.
//!
//! A handled signal cancels the conversation the same way (`cancellation`):
//! each poll of the channel looks for one, and the front looks again once the
//! worker has answered and once it is reaped. The worker is stopped as at the
//! deadline, with TERM and the cleanup grace, and the cancellation is reported
//! whatever else the conversation came to.
