//! Driving a worker directly, without the front: the firing configurations of
//! the hostile classes (`docs/specs/harness-selection-and-execution.md`, the
//! firing-configuration table under *Agreed test seams and acceptance*).
//!
//! A class the public launcher keeps inert is proved only beside a
//! configuration in which the same fixture is seen to fire. For some classes
//! that configuration is a probe build, the shipped worker's source with one
//! control removed, which `task dispatch:probes` compiles for tests only. A
//! probe reports an identity no front accepts, so it cannot be run through the
//! front at all. For `BUN_OPTIONS` it is the shipped worker itself, started
//! without the front's scrubbing. Either way the test plays the front's part:
//! it starts the worker with the cwd and environment the case names, reads its
//! hello, hands it an entry, and reads what it reports.
