//
// The front process hands the worker one end of a socket pair as descriptor 3,
// and nothing else names it: no environment variable, path or argument carries
// the channel, so there is nothing ambient for a policy or a caller to redirect.
// Stdout and stderr stay the policy's diagnostic streams, which the front
// captures separately, so nothing a policy prints can reach a frame.
//
// A frame is a four-byte big-endian length followed by that many bytes of
// UTF-8 JSON. Reads and writes are synchronous: the worker does nothing else while it
// waits for the front, and a synchronous write cannot be reordered with a later
// `process.exit`.
//
// Each frame the worker sends has a bound, which the front applies again as it
// reads: the protocol message bound for a snapshot or a result, the context
// budget for a context. The caller checks a frame's encoded length against its
// bound before sending it, and reports an overflow in a small frame instead.
