/// has exited (a stop is not an exit), its group is killed while the unreaped
/// child still reserves the group's ID. Then the child is reaped, the terminal
/// is taken back with the attributes saved at the handover, and the group is

///
/// Supervision polls three things, and they are the only three ways a launch
