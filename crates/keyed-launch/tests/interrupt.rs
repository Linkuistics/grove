//! The launcher's own SIGTERM: where it is reported, and where it must not be.
//!
//! **One test function, deliberately.** The interrupt latch is process-global,
//! because a signal disposition is, so two test functions in one binary would
//! race each other for it. The phases below therefore run in order inside a
//! single test, and this file is its own integration-test binary so nothing
//! else shares the process.
//!
//! `raise(SIGTERM)` is only safe here *after* a first `run`, which is what
//! installs the handler. Before that the signal takes its default disposition
//! and would kill the test runner — so phase 1 exists to be run, not to assert.
