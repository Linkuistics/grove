//! **Only a wait status can say "was signalled"**, and the only way to produce
//! one is to die of the signal — so this drives a real process death rather
//! than asserting about a return value. The test re-runs *itself* as a child:
//! the branch below fires only when the child's environment variable is set,
//! and the parent half reads the wait status the child leaves behind.
//!
//! Its own integration-test binary, because `reraise` ends the process it is
//! called in and would take every other test in the binary with it.
