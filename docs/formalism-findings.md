# Formalism findings

A running log of what using formal models to drive design and implementation
actually costs and actually buys. It is the raw material for a `linkuistics`
skill on choosing and using a formalism; it is **not** that skill, and it should
not be written as if it were.

## Why this is a log and not a document

The two things this workstream is producing have opposite production schedules.

The **library** converges: decisions get settled, stop moving, and are written
once and edited in place. The **method** accumulates: you cannot know which
formalism suits which situation until you have used several and been burned by
at least one, so its artifact can only be written at the end, from evidence
gathered throughout.

Collapsing those two into one activity fails in both directions. Write the skill
only at the end, and the evidence is gone — a session reconstructing an earlier
session's modelling lesson from memory is exactly the failure this log exists to
prevent. Write it continuously, and you generalise from a single data point,
encoding the accidents of one design as principles.

So: **accumulate here, distil later.** Every session that reaches for a
formalism appends an entry before it retires. A later leaf turns the whole log
into a skill.

## What makes an entry useful

An entry saying "Quint was helpful here" is worth nothing. Six fields, and the
last two are the ones that matter:

1. **Situation** — what was being decided or specified, in one or two sentences.
2. **Formalism** — which one, and *why that one was reached for*.
3. **Caught / missed** — concretely what it found, and what it demonstrably
   failed to find. The misses are as informative as the hits and are the first
   thing a later reader will want.
4. **Cost** — wall-clock, tooling friction, what had to be learned first.
5. **Counterfactual** — what would have caught this earlier or more cheaply.
   *This is the routing evidence.* "Alloy would have found this in one line" is
   what later becomes "reach for Alloy when…".
6. **Verdict** — one line: reach for this again, for this kind of question?

Record misses and dead ends with the same care as successes. A log that only
contains wins produces a skill that only knows how to succeed.

## The hypotheses under test

Stated up front so they can be judged rather than quietly confirmed.

- **H1 — the split is real.** Structural questions ("is this shape coherent?")
  and behavioural ones ("does this operation preserve it?") want different
  tools, and a practitioner can tell which they are holding *before* choosing.
- **H2 — the model leads profitably.** Writing the specification before the
  implementation produces better code than writing it after, and the
  disagreements between the two are worth more than the time they cost.
- **H3 — a specification can drive implementation.** An LLM given a checked
  formal model produces a more faithful implementation than one given prose of
  equivalent length. Untested and, on current evidence, the least certain.

## Entries

### 001 — Prose review, as a baseline

**Situation.** A 365-line architecture document for an ordered-tree-on-disk
library — its data model, its single trait, its operation set, and eight stated
invariants. About to be reviewed by eye and signed off.

**Formalism.** None. This entry is the control: the reviewer asked, of each
operation in turn, *"could I write this as a state-machine action?"* — the
question a model forces — without writing anything.

**Caught.** Three defects, in roughly five minutes.

- *A blocking hole.* The trait could not name a node's distinguished child. Name
  construction was `compose(ordinal, key, parts)`, and a distinguished child has
  neither an ordinal nor a key by definition — so the promotion operation, whose
  whole job is to move a leaf's content into one, had no way to name its own
  output. The prose sentence describing it ("the leaf's content moves verbatim
  into the distinguished child") is perfectly good English and describes an
  impossible operation.
- *A stated invariant that was false.* "Ordinal density: within one node the
  ordinals are exactly `1..n`." Every operation *preserves* density, but nothing
  *establishes* it — allocation is `max + 1`, so a level that already contains a
  gap keeps it forever, and the tree is explicitly meant to be edited by hand.
  The real invariant is distinctness.
- *A missing precondition.* The attribute-rewrite operation took new parts, and
  species was derived from parts, so nothing prevented rewriting a leaf into a
  node — renaming a file into a directory.

**Missed.** Unknown, which is the point of recording this as a baseline. The
entries that follow are what a checked model adds *on top of* asking the
question.

**Cost.** Five minutes, no tooling.

**Counterfactual.** All three would have surfaced while writing the model, and
sooner: the first at the moment the promotion action could not be written at
all, the second at the moment `init` had to say whether the initial state is an
empty tree or an arbitrary well-formed one — a question prose never has to
answer and a specification cannot avoid.

**Verdict.** The *question* is doing much of the work, and it is free. Any
design review should ask it whether or not a model follows. What remains to be
measured is how much the checked model adds beyond it — which is the whole
experiment, and entry 001 is the line it is measured against.

### 002 — Alloy, on the structure of `ordinal-fs-tree`

**Situation.** The same architecture document as entry 001, after that entry's
three defects were fixed: a data model, one trait, an operation set and eight
stated invariants. The question was structural — is the shape coherent, does it
admit anything nonsensical, and can it represent everything the operations need.

**Formalism.** Alloy 6.2. Reached for because the questions were about *shapes*
rather than *sequences*: what a well-formed tree is, whether a claimed
isomorphism is one, whether every entry the library must name is reachable from
the trait's constructors. Alloy answers those with counterexample structures,
which is the shape of the answer wanted.

The model is written assume-guarantee rather than with global facts. Nothing the
document merely claims is an Alloy `fact`; claims are named predicates and every
command declares which it assumes. That is what let one file hold both the
corrected design (`check`, must find nothing) and a reproducible witness for
each defect the correction closes (`run witness_…`, must find an instance). The
witnesses turned out to be the more valuable half: they are the reason a later
reader can see *why* a law is there.

**Caught.** Eight findings. Two were found by the model unprompted — a `check`
failed where it was expected to pass — and those are the ones that count as
evidence about the tool rather than about the modeller.

*Unprompted, from failing checks:*

- **The grammar was not required to be canonical.** The document stated
  `parse(format(n)) == n` and not `format(parse(f)) == f`. A check that a node
  has at most one distinguished child failed, because two filenames may parse to
  one name — at which point two files on disk *are* one entry, sharing a key and
  an ordinal. The invariant list rules this out nowhere.
- **The three `Option` accessors were never tied together.** `ordinal()`,
  `key()` and `parts()` each return `Option` and the document never said when
  each is `Some`. A name of species `Leaf` with no ordinal is admitted: an entry
  that cannot be ordered, shifted or promoted, and that no triple names.

*Prompted — the questions came from the leaf's task file, the answers from the
model:*

- **`promote` still cannot name its output.** This is entry 001's blocking
  defect in a second place, and `distinguished()` does not reach it. Species
  follows from parts; naming the promoted node needs parts implying `Node`; and
  `Parts` is opaque with bounds `Clone + Eq`, so every `Parts` value the library
  can reach already belongs to some entry in the tree. Fixed by taking the
  node's parts from the caller, as `append` and `rewrite` already do.
- **The model corrected the prose argument for that defect.** The first
  formalisation said no reachable name had species `Node`, and Alloy agreed —
  but the formalisation was wrong: the library *can* reach a sibling node's
  parts. Restated with the snapshot's whole parts set, the true claim is
  narrower and still fatal: the reachable names all carry *another entry's*
  label. Getting a witness to fire for the right reason is where the model
  earned its keep, because the overstated version was persuasive prose.
- **Species agreement was an invariant nothing could enforce.** `parse` took a
  filename only, so it could not see that a name declaring a node sat over a
  regular file; the library could see it and had no `Self::Err` with which to
  report it. Fixed by passing what the listing found to `parse`.
- **A distinguished child that is a directory hides a subtree.** Species
  agreement covered `Leaf` and `Node` and said nothing about the third species,
  and a walk does not descend into a distinguished child. Alloy produced a tree
  satisfying every stated invariant with an entire subtree invisible to every
  traversal — the failure mode the Foreign/Malformed distinction exists to
  prevent, arriving by a road the document had not looked down. This is the
  clearest case of the bias that was asked for: *make a bad tree that satisfies
  every stated invariant*.
- **`by_label` is not implementable behind this seam.** The trait names no label
  type, so the operation has nothing to take as an argument; `Parts` equality
  answers *same label* only where the label determines every attribute. Deleted:
  it is `find` with a caller predicate, which the document already prescribes
  for every other attribute question.
- **The invariant list was vague about all of its members, not one.** Density
  was documented as preserved-but-not-established; the model shows that is true
  of *every* invariant, since the library validates nothing it is handed. Saying
  it of one implied the others were stronger.

Two claims were checked and found to need no invariant at all: *at most one
distinguished child per node* follows from a single distinguished name plus
filesystem name uniqueness, and *the parse verdict is total and disjoint*
follows from `Verdict` being a sum type. Both are now documented as free.

**Missed.** More than was caught, and predictably so.

- **Everything with a before and an after.** Three of the eight invariants —
  subtree preservation under shift, identity preservation under promotion, plan
  atomicity — cannot be *stated* in this model, let alone checked. So can "no
  key is ever reissued", which reads like a structural claim and is not.
- **The `by_label` argument is not really Alloy's.** The reasoning is that the
  API surface has no label type — a fact about the trait's signature, which
  Alloy cannot see. The model contributed a premise (label does not determine
  parts) and the conclusion came from reading the trait. Recorded as a miss:
  a reader looking for what the tool found should not be handed this one.
- **Small scopes lie, quietly.** Several checks initially passed over a universe
  too small to hold one node, one leaf and one distinguished child at once. In
  assume-guarantee style a `check` of *laws imply property* also passes for free
  if the laws are unsatisfiable. Two satisfiability witnesses now guard against
  it, and adding them found that a `for 5` guard was itself under-populated.
  Nothing in the tool prompts for this; it has to be a habit.
- **Cost curve is a cliff, not a slope.** `for 6` on the same model hit
  *translation capacity exceeded* — the four-ary `compose` relation is the
  driver. Interesting instances and affordable scopes were nearly the same size,
  which is luck rather than method.

**Cost.** About three hours, of which perhaps twenty minutes was tooling: Alloy
6.2 needs Java 17+ and the machine had 16, so a JDK and the Alloy jar had to be
fetched before anything ran. Alloy has a usable headless CLI (`exec -c`), but it
reports a found instance by printing a table and a not-found by printing
nothing, with exit code 0 either way — so a runner script had to be written
before pass/fail could be read at all. That script is now `run-alloy.sh` and is
the reason the model is re-runnable by a later session. No prior Alloy on this
machine; the relational idiom itself cost little, the scope arithmetic cost more
than expected.

**Counterfactual.** Three different answers, which is the useful part.

- **The canonicity gap** would have been caught by a free checklist question,
  cheaper than any model: *of every claimed isomorphism, is both directions
  stated?* The document said "isomorphic" and stated half. Entry 001's question
  — could I write this as a state-machine action? — would not have found it,
  because it is not an action.
- **The `Option`-completeness gap would have been caught by the type system, for
  nothing.** A name modelled as `enum Name { Positioned { ordinal, key, parts },
  Distinguished }` makes the bad state unrepresentable. This is the sharpest
  routing lesson so far and it points *away* from the tool: before modelling a
  structural property, ask whether the target language already forbids it. Two
  of this document's structural claims were free that way, and modelling them
  taught nothing except that the compiler works.
- **The species-agreement and `promote` defects** would have been caught by an
  implementation attempt — at the moment the code had to construct an error it
  had no constructor for, and at the moment `promote` had to name its output.
  Certainly, but later, and after the trait had consumers. The model found them
  before any code existed, which is the claim H2 makes and the first evidence
  for it.

**Verdict.** Reach for Alloy when the question is *can this shape represent what
I need, and does it admit what I do not want* — above all for reachability
questions, *is every thing I must name reachable from the constructors I have*,
which is where both of this design's blocking defects lived. Do not reach for it
for anything with two states in it, and check first whether the target language's
type system already guarantees the property; two of eight here did.

### Routing table (under construction)

Filled in from the entries above as evidence accumulates. Empty rows are honest;
guesses are not.

| kind of question | formalism | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| structural — "is this shape coherent, and can it even represent what I need?" | Alloy | 002: found two defects unprompted, sharpened two more, produced a tree satisfying every stated invariant with a subtree invisible to every traversal |
| reachability — "is every thing I must name reachable from the constructors I have?" | Alloy | 002: both blocking defects across entries 001 and 002 were this question; it is the one Alloy answers best |
| already guaranteed — "can the target language forbid this outright?" | none — check first | 002: two of eight structural claims were free from Rust's type system; modelling them taught nothing |
| stated-isomorphism — "are both directions written down?" | none — a free question | 002: the canonicity gap was half an isomorphism, and asking costs nothing |
| behavioural — "does this operation preserve the invariant, from any reachable state?" | Quint *(hypothesis)* | 002 (negative): three of eight invariants could not be *stated* in Alloy, and the split was visible before modelling began — first evidence for **H1** |
| universal — "does this hold for all inputs, not just those a checker reached?" | Lean *(untested)* | — |
