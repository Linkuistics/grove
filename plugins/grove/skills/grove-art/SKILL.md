# art

**Load the `grove` skill now** — on Claude Code, where plugin skills are
namespaced, that is `grove:grove` — and read `references/editorial.md` in it.

`draft`, `copy-edit`, `art` and `proof` are one family with one procedure, and
that file is it: what a stage is, the one-charter rule, how the chain is cut,
how work is handed forward and sent back, and what a stage's review allowance
is. This skill states none of it a second time. Everything else — the
constraints, the bootstrap, and the execute, decompose, retire and commit
procedures — is the spine's. What follows is `art`'s, and is stated nowhere else.

**art** (AFK) — the document's figures: what a table, a list figure or a diagram
can carry, and nothing else.

## Work in the medium the document's contract admits, and no other

Where the contract admits only the page's own bytes, a figure is a table, a list
figure or a drawing inside a text fence, and there is no file beside the page.
**Do not introduce a medium the contract does not name.**

## Prefer a shared renderer when diagrams need a unified look

Where the contract admits generated figures, prefer **Typst/CeTZ** for final
drawing when different diagram tools would otherwise produce inconsistent
fonts, line weights, colours or spacing. This is a preference, not a requirement
to migrate every diagram. Preserve the notation's meaning: common styling must
not erase distinctions such as arrow kinds, boundaries or sequence ordering.

Mermaid, PlantUML, Graphviz and similar tools may supply layout, but adopting
their coordinates is a pipeline to prove, not an assumed conversion. Measure
labels with the final fonts and sizes before layout, or recompute layout when
those metrics change. Share typography, strokes, colours, padding and arrow
styles in one drawing module. [CeTZ](https://typst.app/universe/package/cetz/)
provides the drawing layer; notation-specific libraries such as
[Fletcher](https://typst.app/universe/package/fletcher/) can build on it.

Before a broad migration, trial representative diagrams with different
notation and density — for example a dense architecture view and a sequence.
Compare them at publication width, then lengthen a label and add a participant.
Evaluate legibility, semantic fidelity, regeneration and maintenance effort,
and get the owner's reaction before choosing a document-wide migration.

Keep **one authoritative source per figure**: either generate the final drawing
from the layout source, or make the final drawing source authoritative and
retire the superseded source. Do not maintain two independent editable copies.
Record renderer/library/font versions and the regeneration command; inspect
the exported figures in their actual reading environment. Keep the existing
figures until the trial supports changing the document's rendering contract.

## Two rules, and they are the whole charter

- A relation the reader would otherwise have to hold in their head — a sequence,
  a partition, a comparison, a mapping over a set of members — **carried only by
  running prose where a figure would carry it, is a defect**.
- **Every figure states its role**: adjacent to it, a sentence saying what the
  reader is to take from it, not merely what its subject is.

## Record a figure you declined to draw, and say which of three reasons it was

An editorial judgement, a rule in the contract that forbids the fix, and *the
medium could not carry it* are three different findings, and the third is the
only one that is evidence about the medium itself. Name it as such when it is
true, and do not reach for it when the real reason is one of the other two — a
contract's medium is reopened by that record and by nothing else.

**Last act:** `leaf-add` the `proof` leaf, under the family file's rule — which
is conditional, and which a correction run discharges for you.
