description: Contract-preserving project simplification — consolidate current-state documentation, remove proven-dead code and artifacts, shrink dependency and directory surface, and reconcile every consumer. Use when a mature repository has accumulated duplicate docs, historical plans, stale experiments, compatibility scaffolding, or structure that no longer earns its maintenance cost.

# Simplify Project

Reduce the repository's **maintained present** without obscuring a behaviour
change. The goal is fewer maintenance obligations and clearer ownership, not a
large negative line count. Version control already holds the past.

Treat the repository contract as wider than runtime logic. Commands, help text,
configuration, persisted formats, installer paths, package contents, release
mechanics, embedded content, and documented integration points can all be
observable behaviour.

## Establish the preservation ledger

Define the allowed change before proposing deletions. Record the important
surfaces in a small ledger:

| Surface or artifact | Owner / consumers | Preserve or change | Evidence | Action / destination | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tool --help` | CLI users, docs | preserve | captured output | keep grammar | snapshot comparison |

Cover the surfaces that exist in the project:

- public commands, APIs, flags, output, errors, and exit status;
- configuration, defaults, environment variables, persisted formats, and
  supported migrations;
- packages, binaries, workspace membership, dependencies, installers, release
  artifacts, and user-invoked paths;
- embedded or generated content, automation, examples, and downstream
  integrations.

Run the existing checks and capture representative public outputs before editing.
Record pre-existing failures separately. A green post-change suite proves current
correctness; only a before/after comparison supports an equivalence claim.

If simplification requires an observable change, put it in a separate ledger and
change. Name it as compatibility work rather than hiding it inside cleanup.

## Map ownership and reachability

Inventory top-level products, entry points, packages, scripts, documentation,
local/generated state, and release paths. Prefer structural graph or language
tools for code reachability; use text search for paths, links, configuration,
manifests, comments, and non-code consumers. Check downstream repositories or
published paths when the project exposes them.

No universal search depth or deprecation duration proves an external consumer
absent. Use the project's support policy and an authorized contract owner to set
the exit criterion; do not assume the requester holds that authority. Ask when
the answer would change the disposition. When authority or evidence is
unavailable, classify the removal as **Defer**. Replace an old implementation
with a thin compatibility shim only when the shim preserves its complete public
interface; otherwise retain it.

Assign each subject one canonical owner. A useful documentation default is:

| Reader intent | Canonical home |
|---|---|
| orientation and installation | root README |
| commands and workflows | usage guide |
| settings and local state | configuration guide |
| current design and binding rationale | architecture guide or focused ADR |
| recurring operator procedure | release or maintenance runbook |
| component-specific operation | beside the owning component |

Adapt the set to the project; do not create empty categories. Organize by reader
intent and ownership, not by the chronology in which facts were discovered.

## Classify with evidence

Give every candidate one disposition:

| Disposition | Evidence required |
|---|---|
| **Keep** | Current contract, live migration/adapter, unique binding rationale, operational procedure, licence, or provenance. |
| **Fold** | A current fact is duplicated or fragmented; select one owner and migrate every unique fact and stable anchor. |
| **Move** | The artifact has a clear component owner; reconcile internal and external path consumers. |
| **Delete** | No supported consumer remains, durable conclusions already have a home, and VCS is the only reason to retain the narrative. |
| **Defer** | Reachability, compatibility policy, ownership, or legal provenance remains uncertain. |

Use the deletion test from `codebase-design` for modules and abstractions: if
deletion makes the complexity disappear, the module was likely scaffolding; if
the same complexity spreads into callers, it was earning its keep. Use
`decision-records` when pruning ADRs: keep the minimum coherent set that explains
the current design and let VCS retain superseded decisions.

Typical delete candidates are completed plans, superseded specs, task logs,
research whose durable findings were promoted, stale generated state, one-off
experiments, unreachable packages, and their dependency closure. A compatibility
adapter is not stale merely because it is old: retain it while a supported input,
persisted format, or downstream consumer still crosses that seam.

## Design the target state

Before deleting, write down:

- the target product, package, binary, and dependency set;
- the canonical owner of each retained fact;
- an old-to-new path and anchor map;
- the evidence for each removal;
- every approved observable difference.

Prefer fewer, deeper documents and modules over one giant document or a prettier
folder tree. Consolidation succeeds when a reader or caller has fewer surfaces to
learn while the necessary behaviour and rationale remain available.

## Execute in coherent slices

1. Create or reshape the canonical owners. Migrate unique current facts,
   invariants, failure modes, provenance, and stable anchors.
2. Reconcile inbound references: source comments, tests, help, READMEs,
   manifests, automation, packaging, catalogues, and release instructions.
3. Move component-owned material beside its owner. Separate a move from a
   semantic rewrite when that makes review clearer.
4. Delete superseded artifacts. Remove a dead executable or package as one
   complete maintenance obligation: source, workspace/build entries,
   dependencies, tests, packaging, and lockfile residue.
5. Update the changelog and any user-facing migration or deprecation guidance.

Keep each slice reviewable and reversible through the repository's native VCS.
Run the relevant checks after each slice rather than deferring all feedback to
the end.

## Prove the result

- Re-run formatting, linting, tests, builds, and repository-specific checks.
- Compare the preservation ledger's public outputs, schemas, defaults, package
  metadata, binary list, installed tree, and release artifacts before and after.
- Exercise installers, migration paths, packaging, and release dry-runs in
  isolated temporary environments; never test destructive install behaviour
  against the operator's real home or live configuration.
- Search for every removed name, path, slug, anchor, package, and dependency.
  Classify intentional history-only hits such as changelog entries.
- Check documentation links, anchors, navigation, ownership statements, and
  contradictions between canonical guides.
- Inspect the final diff and VCS status for unrelated files and tool-generated
  residue.

The simplification is complete when every contract difference is approved,
every deletion has evidence, every retained fact has one canonical owner, live
references resolve, supported migrations still work, and the repository has
fewer concepts or surfaces to maintain. Lines and files removed are supporting
metrics, never the acceptance test.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---|---|
| Treating “no runtime logic changed” as equivalence | Include help, paths, packaging, embedded content, and operations in the contract. |
| Keeping historical artifacts “for context” | Promote current lessons; let VCS hold the narrative. |
| Deleting before consolidation | Establish canonical owners and migrate unique facts first. |
| Trusting no in-repo callers | Check release, automation, documentation, and downstream consumers. |
| Optimizing line count | Optimize maintenance obligations and interface depth. |
| Removing compatibility because it looks old | Require support-policy and consumer evidence. |
| Running only post-change tests | Capture baselines and compare observable surfaces. |
