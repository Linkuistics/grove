# Load check for the technical-communication Pi extension. It spends no model
# quota: it starts Pi in RPC mode, which loads the extension and fires
# `session_start` without a prompt, and then reads what the extension did.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. A broken extension stops Pi from starting in every mode, and
# the install links this file into every Pi session on the machine. Pi also
# accepts an unknown event name without a word, so a renamed event would leave a
# dead handler and no error. Loading alone proves neither of those things, so the
# check asserts the one effect that needs the extension to load, to find the hook
# core through its own path and to register a working `session_start` handler:
# a start record in the reply log.
#
# THE CONTROLS. A clean run proves little when the instrument may be broken, so
# each claim has a run that must fail:
#   - an extension that throws must print Pi's load error (Pi exits 0 in RPC
#     mode even then, so the message on standard error is the only signal);
#   - the same extension with the off file present must write nothing.
#
# It does not test the other four layers, which need a model request. Those were
# shown in a real session (.grove, `pi-always-on-k13`).
#
# Run: bash scripts/pi-extension-load.test.sh
# Skipped, with exit 0 and a visible message, when `pi` is not installed.
