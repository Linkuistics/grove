# NO METHODOLOGY PAIRING ASSERTION. Until delete-provisioning-k19 this file
# carried CONTENT_MARKER -- a phrase that existed only in content/ -- and
# assert_methodology_pairing, which grepped each staged binary for it and failed
# the release if either lacked the embed. The check ran here rather than only in
# the Rust suite because a release builds three targets in --release, two of them
# cross-compiled, so a linker or codegen setting that kept the embed out of a
# shipped binary was not something the test-profile pair could speak to.
#
# Codex startup now uses a plugin snapshot embedded in grove alone. The old
# content/ marker and dual-binary pairing contract remain retired; provisioning
# tests verify the new installation boundary.

# Put rustup's shim directory at the FRONT of PATH, so the release build gets a
# coherent rustup toolchain rather than whatever `cargo` happens to resolve to.
#
# WHY THIS SETS RATHER THAN DIAGNOSES. The two Linux targets are rustup-managed;
# Homebrew's `rust` formula ships its own cargo *and* rustc that know nothing
# about them, and on a machine with both installed Homebrew's wins on PATH. The
# result is `error[E0463]: can't find crate for 'std'` several minutes into a
# release build. That has now cost two releases (ship-release-k25,
# observe-mid-turn-live-k31) *despite being known both times* — a remedy the
# operator must remember every time is not a remedy, so the script does it.
# The pin is announced, not silent: the doctor prints the cargo and rustc it
# settled on, and the target check below verifies the outcome rather than
# assuming it.
#
# WHY PATH AND NOT SOMETHING NARROWER. Two narrower remedies were measured and
# rejected:
#   - Resolving `CARGO="$(rustup which cargo)"` and invoking it by absolute path
#     does NOT work. cargo finds `rustc` via $RUSTC or PATH, so rustup's cargo
#     drives Homebrew's rustc and fails identically.
#   - `rustup run <toolchain> cargo …` does NOT work either. It sets only
#     $RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN and leaves PATH untouched, so on a machine whose PATH
#     lacks the shim directory it resolves Homebrew's binaries and changes
#     nothing.
# Setting $RUSTC alone does work, but leaves a mixed toolchain (one vendor's
# cargo, another's rustc). Prepending the shim directory gives cargo, rustc and
# the cargo-* subcommands from one rustup toolchain, and honours a
# rust-toolchain.toml if this repo ever grows one.
#
# No-op when rustup is not installed; check_rust_toolchain reports the fallout.
