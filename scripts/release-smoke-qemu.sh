#
# One Linux target's installed smoke test in the glibc-2.17 userland under a
# pinned user-mode QEMU emulating the target's CPU floor, CPU.
# scripts/release-smoke.sh runs this as root in a helper container of Docker's
# own architecture; it is not an entry point of its own.
#
#   release-smoke-qemu.sh INPUTS TARGET ARCHIVE CPU
#
# INPUTS, read-only, holds everything the run reads: rootfs.tar, the floor
# image's filesystem for TARGET's architecture; qemu, the pinned emulator;
# interpreter, the binfmt_misc interpreter release-smoke.sh builds, which runs
# qemu with the options this target needs and -cpu CPU, and interpreter-max,
# its twin with -cpu max; release-smoke-target.sh, installed-smoke.sh, the
# glibc and CPU probes in probes/, ARCHIVE, and elf-headers, the first 20
# bytes of each ELF file in ARCHIVE.
#
# The userland is the same image the container route runs, unpacked into
# /floor and entered with chroot as uid 1000. Its executables reach qemu
# through binfmt_misc, even where the helper's architecture could run them
# itself, and the registration must not touch the Docker host's own, which
# every other container uses. So it
# goes into a private binfmt_misc instance, which the kernel (6.7 and later)
# gives each user namespace that mounts one. The namespace maps uids and gids
# 0-65535 to themselves, so root inside it is the container's root, and uid
# 1000 in the chroot owns nothing there, as in the container route.
#
# Before the smoke test, the guest's own /proc/self/maps must show a vDSO and
# no mapping at or above the target's user address limit but the vsyscall
# page. Docker Desktop's QEMU 8.1.5 gives x86-64 guests no vDSO, and QEMU
# 10.2.3 without a guest base maps them above 2^47 (docs/design/
# harness-selection-and-execution/runtime-evidence.md, *Installed smoke*); either
# would otherwise run the smoke test in an environment no x86-64 kernel makes.
# Then the CPU model must be seen to refuse an instruction beyond it, which
# the twin interpreter's -cpu max executes (release-smoke.sh, WHY A CPU MODEL).
