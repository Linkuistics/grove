# grove-v<version>-<target>.tar.xz, into a fresh prefix with this environment's
# own tar, checks that grove, grove-llm and harness-dispatch report that
# version, and hands the prefix to harness-dispatch's installed-layout cases,
# CASES (crates/harness-dispatch/scripts/installed-smoke.sh). Like those cases,
# it needs only bash 3.2, coreutils, grep and cmp, because macOS's /bin/bash
