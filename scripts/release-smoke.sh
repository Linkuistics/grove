# The installed-layout smoke test of the release archives: each target's
# archive, extracted where that target runs and exercised with no Bun or Node
# on PATH.
#
#   scripts/release-smoke.sh [--archives DIR] [TARGET...]
#
# DIR holds one grove-v<version>-<target>.tar.xz per target; the default is
# target/archives, which `task release:archives` fills. The default targets are
# every release target. `task release:smoke` rebuilds the archives from the
# working copy first, so it never reads a stale one; the release task runs this
# over target/dist before it publishes anything. Each archive must first match
# release-common.sh's archive manifest, as the build checked it.
#
#   aarch64-apple-darwin      natively. It needs a macOS arm64 host.
#   *-unknown-linux-gnu       in a glibc-2.17 userland of the target's
#                             architecture, under a pinned user-mode QEMU
#                             emulating the target's CPU floor (WHY A CPU
#                             MODEL, below). A target native to Docker also
#                             runs in a container of that userland first. It
#                             needs an arm64 Docker, and Zig, which builds the
#                             controls' probes and QEMU's interpreter; Docker
#                             on any other architecture is refused.
#
# scripts/release-smoke-target.sh runs inside each environment: it asserts the
# environment, extracts the archive with that environment's tar into a fresh
# prefix, checks the versions, and runs harness-dispatch's installed-layout
# cases, crates/harness-dispatch/scripts/installed-smoke.sh.
#
# WHY A CONTROL. A userland that is not really at the floor passes everything a
# floor userland passes. So each Linux run also executes a pair of probes built
# from one C source: one against glibc 2.17, which must run, and one that calls
# getrandom against glibc 2.25, which the userland must refuse for its
# GLIBC_2.25 symbol version. The first shows the userland runs binaries of that
# architecture at all; the refusal of the second then shows it enforces 2.17.
# The observed refusal is printed on every run.
#
# WHY OUR OWN QEMU. Docker Desktop on Apple silicon emulates amd64 with QEMU
# 8.1.5, which gives x86-64 guests no vDSO, and CentOS 7's glibc then crashes
# (docs/design/harness-selection-and-execution/runtime-evidence.md, *Installed
# smoke*). QEMU 10.2.3 supplies the vDSO, but with no reserved address space it
# bounds a 64-bit guest by nothing, so on an arm64 kernel with 48-bit addresses
# it maps the guest above 2^47, where no x86-64 kernel maps a process; the
# worker's JavaScriptCore heap then cannot allocate. Reserving the space (-R)
# fails, because QEMU maps the vsyscall page at 0xffffffffff600000. A guest base
# of 2^47 (-B 0x800000000000) maps the host's upper half onto the guest's
# [0, 2^47) instead. The worker's front scrubs QEMU_* from its environment, so
# the options reach QEMU through a native interpreter registered in
# binfmt_misc, and scripts/release-smoke-qemu.sh registers it in a private
# instance, leaving the Docker host's own registration alone.
#
# WHY A CPU MODEL. A binary built for a newer CPU than the floor passes every
# test on a newer CPU, and Bun's x64 runtime chooses AVX2 code paths when the
# CPU has them. So each Linux target's smoke test runs under QEMU emulating the
# floor's CPU: Nehalem for x86_64, the Cortex-A53 for aarch64, the models Bun's
# own baseline verification emulates. A model that accepted newer instructions
# would pass everything, so before the smoke test a probe that executes one
# instruction beyond the model (AVX2 on x86_64, an Armv8.1 LSE atomic on
# aarch64) must be killed by SIGILL under it, and must run under the same QEMU
# and options with -cpu max. x86_64 on an arm64 Docker already runs under QEMU,
# so its one emulated run covers both floors. aarch64 runs natively in its
# container, then again emulated. tonistiigi/binfmt's arm64 image omits the
# emulator for its own architecture, so aarch64's QEMU is Debian's.
#
# The Linux environments see only their inputs, read only, and run the smoke
# test as an unprivileged user with no network. Neither a container nor
# user-mode emulation observes the kernel floor, which is Bun's documented
# range; see docs/specs/harness-selection-and-execution.md, *Delivery and
# release*.
